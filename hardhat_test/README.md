# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli 

if you only want to call functions and not redeploy
npx hardhat run scripts/trigger_proofs.js --network goerli  

Integration testing for API: 
npx hardhat test --network goerli

```
